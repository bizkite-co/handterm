# Plan to Fix Issue #59

**Issue:** #59 - HandTermWrapper > should maintain single prompt after activity changes

**Problem:** The prompt is being duplicated (`> > `) after activity changes or edits.  The Vitest test "should maintain correct prompt after activity changes" is failing.

**Cause (Hypothesis):** Some interaction between `HandTermWrapper`, `useTerminal`, and potentially React's rendering behavior is causing the prompt to be written twice. The logic in `useTerminal`'s `resetPrompt` and `getCurrentCommand` functions might be flawed, incorrectly determining whether to write the prompt. The mocking strategy was too complex and not correctly simulating the asynchronous initialization of the terminal.

**Goal:** Ensure the prompt is always displayed as `'> '` when appropriate (i.e., not in `EDIT` mode) and never duplicated. The test should pass reliably.

**Steps (Revised):**

1.  **Focus on a Single Test (Done):**  The test `src/components/HandTermWrapper.test.tsx` > `describe('HandTermWrapper', ...)` > `test('should maintain correct prompt after activity changes', ...)` is the current focus. Other tests are temporarily commented out.

2.  **Simplify Mocks (Done):** The `react-xtermjs` mock in the test file has been simplified to the bare minimum.

3.  **Ensure Correct Typing (Done):** Type errors related to mocking and `IHandTermWrapperProps` have been addressed. `onOutputUpdate` is optional in the interface. The mock function is correctly typed and assigned in `beforeEach`.

4.  **Use `waitFor` and `act` (Done):** The test uses `waitFor` and `act` to handle asynchronous updates.

5.  **Verify Mocking of `useTerminal` Dependencies (Done):** All external dependencies of `useTerminal` are now mocked (`react-xtermjs`, `@xterm/addon-fit`, `../utils/commandUtils`, `../signals/commandLineSignals`, `../signals/appSignals`).

6.  **Verify `xtermRef` Handling (Done):** Ensured that `xtermRef` is correctly attached to the `div` in `HandTermWrapper`, and that the `id` and `data-testid` attributes are set.

7.  **Verify `isReady` Logic (Done):** `useTerminal` now has an `isReady` state that is set to `true` after the `xterm` instance is initialized. `HandTermWrapper`'s `useEffect` hook uses this `isReady` state.

8.  **Run and Debug (Next Step):** Run the single test repeatedly and observe the console output. If the test still fails, analyze the output and component behavior to identify the root cause. It may be necessary to add more logging or use the debugger.

9.  **Refactor (if necessary):** If the mocking strategy is still overly complex or brittle, consider refactoring the component or the tests to make them easier to test.

10. **Expand Test Coverage:** Once the single test is passing reliably, uncomment the other tests and address any remaining issues.

11. **Consider Test Utilities:** Evaluate creating a `TerminalTestUtils` class to encapsulate terminal interactions.

12. **Document:** Update this plan with any further learnings.

**Recent Learnings:**

*   Vitest's mocking system can be tricky, especially with asynchronous behavior and component lifecycles.
*   Careful attention to types is crucial when working with mocks.
*   Using `waitFor` and `act` is essential for handling asynchronous updates in React testing.
*   Simplifying mocks and focusing on testing behavior rather than implementation details can help.
*   A more structured approach to test utilities (similar to Page Objects) might be beneficial.
* The -t flag for vitest needs to be used with caution, as the test name needs to be precise.
* The `mockClear()` method is available on mock functions.
* The `mock` property of a mock function contains information about how the mock has been called.
* The `instance` is not directly available in the `HandTermWrapper` component; it's within the `useTerminal` hook.
* The `xtermRef` is used to access the terminal instance *after* it's been initialized.
* The `useEffect` hook in `HandTermWrapper` that calls `resetPrompt` and `term.focus()` should only run when `currentActivity` is `NORMAL` *and* `isReady` is true.
* The `onData` event listener should be set up within the `useTerminal` hook.
* The `onOutputUpdate` prop should receive an `OutputElement` object.
* The `mockOnOutputUpdate` variable should be declared outside of `beforeEach` and initialized within it.
* The `mockProps` object should not include an initial value for `onOutputUpdate`.
* The `mock.calls` property of a mock function can be used to access the arguments passed to the mock function.
* The `some` and `every` methods can be used to check if any or all calls to a mock function satisfy a condition.

**Next Steps:**

1.  Run the single test using: `npm run test -- -t "HandTermWrapper > should maintain correct prompt after activity changes"`
2.  Analyze the test results and console output.
3.  If the test still fails, add more logging to `useTerminal` and `HandTermWrapper` to pinpoint the exact timing of events and state changes.
4.  Consider refactoring the component or test if the mocking strategy remains too complex.
5.  Explore creating a `TerminalTestUtils` class.
6.  Research Vitest best practices for mocking and test organization.

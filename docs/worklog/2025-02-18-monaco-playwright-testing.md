# Worklog: Monaco-Playwright Testing (2025-02-18)

**Task:** Get the test `src/e2e/page-objects/EditorPage.spec.ts` working.

**Understanding of the Problem:**

The test is failing because the `setupBrowserWindow` function, which is responsible for setting up the browser environment for Playwright tests, is throwing an error. The error message indicates that the verification step within `setupBrowserWindow` is failing because `hasSignals` is false. This means that the Playwright `page.evaluate` call is not detecting the expected signals (`tutorialSignal` and `completedTutorialsSignal`) on the `window` object.

Previous attempts to fix this by modifying how the signals are initialized and exposed in `setupBrowserWindow` have not been successful. This suggests that the issue might be related to:

1.  **Timing:** The signals might not be fully initialized before the `page.evaluate` call is executed.
2.  **Scope:** The signals might not be correctly scoped or accessible within the `page.evaluate` context.
3.  **Underlying Issue with Monaco/Playwright Integration:** There might be a fundamental incompatibility or specific configuration requirement for using Monaco Editor with Playwright that I'm missing.

**Plan:**

1.  **Re-examine `setupBrowserWindow`:** Carefully review the code and the test output to understand the sequence of events and how the signals are being used.
2.  **Investigate Signal Initialization and Usage:**
    *   **Console Logging:** Add console logs within the `addInitScript` blocks and the `page.evaluate` block to check the values of the signals at different points in time. This will help determine if the signals are being initialized and if their values are what I expect.
    *   **Simplified Verification:** Temporarily simplify the verification step in `setupBrowserWindow` to check for the existence of the `window` object itself, then gradually add back the signal checks to isolate the problem.
3.  **Research Playwright and Monaco Editor Integration:**
    *   Search for documentation, examples, and troubleshooting tips related to using Monaco Editor with Playwright.
    *   Look for known issues or specific configuration requirements.
4.  **Create a Minimal, Reproducible Example:** If the issue persists, create a minimal example that isolates the problem.
5. **Iterate and Refine:** Based on my findings, I'll adjust my approach and continue testing until the issue is resolved.

**Next Steps:**

1. Add console logs to `setupBrowserWindow` to investigate signal initialization and usage.

# Worklog: Update Test Script

**Date:** 2025-02-22

**Task:** Update `scripts/test-history/commit_test_retrospector.sh` to run Vitest and Playwright, generate JUnit XML reports, and store them in commit-specific directories.

**Understanding of the Problem:**

The current script runs only e2e tests and saves the raw output. The goal is to:

1.  Run both Vitest and Playwright tests.
2.  Generate JUnit XML reports for each.
3.  Store reports in `commit-test-results/<commit-id>/`.

**Plan:**

1.  Examine existing script.
2.  Configure Vitest for JUnit output.
3.  Configure Playwright for JUnit output.
4.  Modify script to:
    *   Run both test runners.
    *   Create output directories.
    *   Pass correct configuration for XML reports.

**Improvements Implemented:**

1. Direct tool invocation via npx instead of npm scripts
2. Error handling with `|| true` to continue on test failures
3. Force checkout/restore of original branch
4. Separate log files for each test run
5. Progress output with indentation
6. Safer directory structure handling

**Verification Plan:**

1. Test against commits with known test configurations
2. Verify XML reports are generated even when tests fail
3. Check log files contain detailed execution output
4. Confirm original branch is restored reliably

# Worklog: Update Test Script

**Date:** 2025-02-22

**Task:** Update `scripts/test-history/commit_test_retrospector.sh` to run Vitest and Playwright, generate JUnit XML reports, and store them in commit-specific directories.

**Understanding of the Problem:**

The current script runs only e2e tests and saves the raw output. The goal is to:

1.  Run both Vitest and Playwright tests.
2.  Generate JUnit XML reports for each.
3.  Store reports in `commit-test-results/<commit-id>/`.

**Plan:**

1.  Examine existing script.
2.  Configure Vitest for JUnit output.
3.  Configure Playwright for JUnit output.
4.  Modify script to:
    *   Run both test runners.
    *   Create output directories.
    *   Pass correct configuration for XML reports.

**Final Improvements Implemented:**

1. External script location with target repo parameter
2. Output stored in script directory instead of target repo
3. Full path validation and error checking
4. Subshell operations to isolate git changes
5. Maintained all previous reliability improvements

**Verification Updates:**
1. Test with invalid repo path
2. Verify outputs are created outside target repo
3. Confirm script handles dirty working directory
4. Test cross-commit compatibility

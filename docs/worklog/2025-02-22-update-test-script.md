# Worklog: Update Test Script

**Date:** 2025-02-22

**Task:** Update `scripts/test-history/commit_test_retrospector.sh` to run Vitest and Playwright, generate JUnit XML reports, and store them in commit-specific directories.

**Understanding of the Problem:**

The current script runs only e2e tests and saves the raw output. The goal is to:

1.  Run both Vitest and Playwright tests.
2.  Generate JUnit XML reports for each.
3.  Store reports in `commit-test-results/<commit-id>/`.

**Plan:**

1.  Examine existing script.
2.  Configure Vitest for JUnit output.
3.  Configure Playwright for JUnit output.
4.  Modify script to:
    *   Run both test runners.
    *   Create output directories.
    *   Pass correct configuration for XML reports.

**Next Steps:**

1.  Modify `commit_test_retrospector.sh` with the new logic.

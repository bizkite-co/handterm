# Task: Resolve TypeScript Type Errors

## Problem Summary

This project is experiencing persistent TypeScript type errors, primarily related to the `monaco-editor` and `@testing-library/jest-dom` types, as well as other general type resolution issues across multiple files. These errors arose after attempting to consolidate `tsconfig` path aliases and persist even after dependency reinstallation. There is also a dependency conflict between `eslint` and `eslint-plugin-total-functions`.

## Investigation Steps

1.  **Confirm Current Error State:**
    *   Run `npm run type-check` to get a clear list of current errors.

2.  **Inspect `tsconfig` Files:**
    *   Carefully review `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.base.json`, and `packages/types/tsconfig.json`.
    *   Pay close attention to the `include`, `exclude`, `types`, `typeRoots`, and `paths` options.
    *   Look for inconsistencies or misconfigurations that might affect type resolution.

3.  **Analyze `packages/types/src/monaco.ts`:**
    *   Examine how `monaco-editor` types are being imported and used.
    *   Check for any incorrect type references or usage patterns.

4.  **Verify Package Versions and Type Definitions:**
    *   Check `node_modules/monaco-editor/package.json` for the installed version.
    *   Check `node_modules/@types/testing-library__jest-dom/package.json` for the installed version.
    *   Verify that both packages include type definition files (usually `.d.ts` files).

5.  **Online Research:**
    *   Search for similar issues online using queries like:
        *   "monaco-editor typescript type errors"
        *   "tsconfig path alias issues"
        *   Specific error messages encountered during type checking.

6.  **Check TypeScript Version:**
    *   Verify the TypeScript version specified in `package.json` (`devDependencies`).
    *   Ensure the version is compatible with `monaco-editor` and other dependencies.

7.  **Review ESLint Configuration:**
    *   Examine `.eslintrc.cjs` and any related ESLint configuration files.
    *   Look for potential conflicts or misconfigurations that might interfere with type checking.

## Potential Solutions (Explore after investigation)

1.  **Adjust `tsconfig` Configurations:**
    *   Modify `include`, `exclude`, `types`, `typeRoots`, or `paths` in the relevant `tsconfig` files to ensure correct type resolution.

2.  **Explicitly Install `@types/monaco-editor`:**
    *   Try installing `@types/monaco-editor` as a devDependency, even though `monaco-editor` should include its own types:
        ```bash
        npm install --save-dev @types/monaco-editor
        ```

3.  **Adjust Import Statements:**
    *   Modify how `monaco-editor` types are imported in `packages/types/src/monaco.ts`.

4.  **Resolve Dependency Conflicts:**
    *   If the `eslint` conflict persists, consider using `npm-force-resolutions` or a similar tool to force a compatible version.

5.  **Update/Downgrade Packages:**
    *   If necessary, update or downgrade `monaco-editor`, `@types/testing-library__jest-dom`, or other related packages to versions known to be compatible.

6.  **Simplify `tsconfig`:**
    *   If possible, further simplify the `tsconfig` structure to reduce complexity.

7.  **Check for Conflicting Global Type Definitions:**
    *   Investigate if any globally installed type definitions are interfering.

## Verification

1.  After implementing each potential solution, run `npm run type-check` to check if the errors are resolved.
2.  Run tests (`npm run test`) to ensure no regressions have been introduced.
